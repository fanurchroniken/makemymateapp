## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Logic Apps request failed: 401"
**Solution**: Check API key and authentication in Logic Apps

### Issue: "Logic Apps request failed: 400"
**Solution**: Verify JSON structure matches expected schema

### Issue: "Logic Apps request failed: 500"
**Solution**: Check Logic Apps workflow logs for internal errors

### Issue: Image generation fails
**Solution**: Verify Replicate API token and model availability

### Issue: Supabase storage fails
**Solution**: Check Supabase connection and bucket permissions

## üìà Performance Testing

### Expected Response Times
- **Text Generation**: 5-15 seconds
- **Image Generation**: 30-60 seconds
- **Total Pipeline**: 45-90 seconds

### Load Testing
- Test with multiple concurrent requests
- Monitor Logic Apps execution history
- Check for rate limiting on external APIs

## üîß Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Logic Apps Logging**: Turn on detailed logging in Azure Portal
2. **Check Execution History**: Review each step in the workflow
3. **Test Individual Steps**: Test Azure OpenAI and Replicate separately
4. **Monitor Costs**: Track API usage and costs
5. **Validate Outputs**: Check each step's output format

## üìù Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: English Dark Romance Character
- Use `sample-logic-apps-request.json`
- Expect gothic/dark aesthetic
- Verify English language content

### Scenario 2: German Fantasy Character
- Use `sample-logic-apps-request-de.json`
- Expect German language content
- Verify proper character generation

### Scenario 3: Edge Cases
- Test with minimal quiz answers
- Test with extreme slider values (0, 10)
- Test with special characters in answers

## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing

1. **Integration**: Connect to your Next.js app
2. **Environment Variables**: Add Logic Apps URL to `.env.local`
3. **Error Handling**: Implement fallback mechanisms
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for failures
5. **Optimization**: Fine-tune prompts and parameters
